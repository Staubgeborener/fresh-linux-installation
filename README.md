# fresh-linux-installation
Just my setup after a fresh reinstall of my linux distribution. Support for apt (like debian/ubuntu) and pacman (arch).

I will update this from time to time.

## How to use
Run as root:
```shell
bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Staubgeborener/fresh-linux-installation/master/setup.sh)
```
